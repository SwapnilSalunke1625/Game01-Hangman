# Game01-Hangman
This is a classic Hangman game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game provides a fun and interactive experience for users where they can guess the hidden word by selecting letters from an on-screen keyboard. Players are given a set number of incorrect guesses, and with each wrong guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn.
